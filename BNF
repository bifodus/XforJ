#
# This is a non standard BNF that describes the JSL grammar.  
#
# Character sequences not wrapped in ' are Non-Terminals.
#
# Non-Terminals may contain Terminals, Productions, and Non-Terminals.  
# Recursion is allowed.
#
# Non-Terminals ending in : are Productions in the grammar.
#
# Character sequences wrapped in ' are Terminals.
#
# The + symbol is used to concat Terminals and Non-Terminals.
#
# The character sequence @"value" is used to provide an attribute to Symbols
# in the grammar.
#
# Regular expressions of the form /regex/ denote an acceptable sequence of 
# Terminals.  The regex flavor of choice is Perl.
